    abstract = {A global particle and power balance calculation is carried out to assess the accessible plasma parameter range in a toroidal confined low temperature plasma. Power and particle sources and sinks are calculated from the relevant atomic processes. The balance is fulfilled for hyperbolic-like curves in the temperature–density plane. They constitute an upper limit accessible for plasmas at a given heating power, neutral density, and sort of gas. The calculations are compared with results from the TJ-K torsatron [N. Krause, C.

abstract = {For researchers wishing to generate an understanding of complex plasma systems, global models often present an attractive first step, mainly due to their ease of development and use. These volume averaged models are able to give descriptions of plasmas with complex chemical kinetics, and without the computationally intensive numerical methods required for spatially resolved models. This paper gives a tutorial on global modeling, including development and techniques, and provides a discussion on the issues and pitfalls that researchers should be aware of. Further discussion is provided in the form of two reviews on methods of extending global modeling techniques to encompass variations in either time or space.},

title = {Foundations of modelling of nonequilibrium low-temperature plasmas},
journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
abstract = {This work explains the need for plasma models, introduces arguments for choosing the type of model that better fits the purpose of each study, and presents the basics of the most common nonequilibrium low-temperature plasma models and the information available from each one, along with an extensive list of references for complementary in-depth reading. The paper presents the following models, organised according to the level of multi-dimensional description of the plasma: kinetic models, based on either a statistical particle-in-cell/Monte-Carlo approach or the solution to the Boltzmann equation (in the latter case, special focus is given to the description of the electron kinetics); multi-fluid models, based on the solution to the hydrodynamic equations; global (spatially-average) models, based on the solution to the particle and energy rate-balance equations for the main plasma species, usually including a very complete reaction chemistry; mesoscopic models for plasma–surface interaction, adopting either a deterministic approach or a stochastic dynamical Monte-Carlo approach. For each plasma model, the paper puts forward the physics context, introduces the fundamental equations, presents advantages and limitations, also from a numerical perspective, and illustrates its application with some examples. Whenever pertinent, the interconnection between models is also discussed, in view of multi-scale hybrid approaches.}
